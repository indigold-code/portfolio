                        <h5>My Objective</h5>
                        <p>I am commited to continuing to develop and showcase my ability to code until I am able to land my first job as a software developer</p>
                        <p>Early in 2022 I had a realization that I needed this career change, and I wanted to do something drastic. My wife and I had a
                         good amount saved and we felt like it was time to start a new chapter. We sold most of our belongings and left behind our life in
                         Berlin to travel and learn. It has been almost exactly one year and I have gone from little knowledge of computer science to a 
                         certified d eveloper building clean back-ends and a bit of front to polish my work with a nice finishing touch. We started by visiting 
                         our friends in Costa Rica, and ended up with a little apartment in Mexico. I spend my days learning and working on new projects, while
                          relaxing and enjoying the environment with my Wife and our cat Alfy we brought along for the adventure.</p> <br/>

                        <p>Working for a tech startup in Berlin for just over 3 years I learned a lot. I earned the opportunity to work part
                             time as a Junior Process Manager as a project for personal development. During this time I was able to learn all 
                             about the lifecycle of proccesses and software. Working closely with the team of engineers to innovate and deploy new 
                             and creative solutions made me realize I had a passion for this type of work. This inspired me heavily to commit to
                              learning more and making a full career change.</p>

                        <p>I received a Back-end Developer Certification By Meta on Coursera. I was eager to make a career switch, but having trouble
                             seeing a clear path on my own. Commiting to learning through this platform caused me to grow exponentially in my knowledge
                              of computer science and software engineering.</p>

                        <h5>Volunteer work</h5><br/>
                        <strong>Teaching English:</strong> <p>In April 2016 my soon to be wife and I flew to Hanoi, Vietnam to experience a different 
                            culture or way of life while doing some volunteer work. We explored Hanoi for two weeks while teaching english at a local 
                            school</p>
                        <strong>Temple Service:</strong> <p> November 2015, I was freshly graduated from highschool and recently turned 18, I was ready
                             for a new adventure. I got in my car and started a several thousand mile road trip around the western United States,
                              I stopped in Utah for just over one month to volunteer at the Hare Krishna Hindu Temple. At the temple I exchanged
                               35 hours of temple service weekly for a bed in the ashram and meals from the indian buffet</p>
